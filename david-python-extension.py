From: Dave
Subject: Unrooting phones

Message Body:
I recently rooted my HTC Incredible and found a whole slew of new apps and functionality that I really like. I also found out that my work email frontend program (good for enterprise) checks for rooting and locks up if it detects that your phone is rooted.

Now I know I can unroot my phone without going back to factory settings, but I want to know a few things before I jump back:

1: will superuser permissions granted while rooted continue to be in effect after the de-rooting (ie does it permanently give permission by changing the rom or making the program privileged)?
2: If I changed to a ROM that offers the additional functionality that I am looking for (Cyanodroid for instance) and then unroot will those additional functions continue to work?
3: Is there any way to stop programs from being able to check rooting in the first place?

I think these would be good topics to address in your FAQ, and would really appreciate if you could shed any light on the subject.
Thanks,
Dave

Elders,

 

The July schedule is attached.  Due to unexpected and unrelated complications from my wife’s knee replacement surgery…I have scheduled myself out of the 11:30 HE rotation until mid-July.  For the remaining Sundays…however…I will remain in a supporting role and will notify the HE if I am unable to serve on a particular Sunday.

 

Pastors…the service HEs will inform you of altered communion flow practices based on available resources should the need arise.

 

Sarah/Theresa…please post in the elders closet.  The elders will update this schedule in real time so please reference the schedule as posted in the closet for the latest information to post in the bulletins.

 

In Him,

Rick

Good Morning to all hope you all had a great weekend.  The deposit bag number for 06/19/2011 for the 1010 service is #2247938.  Thank you.  
I want to add that we all make it a point today to say a prayer for healing for our very own Kathleen Ramirez. She is a wonderful gift that God has given our church and does so much for us. 
Thank you and God Bless,
David Cesolini

Yeah sorry its been a long time don't remember you, and also sorry it took so long to write back. But my son hasn't been doing so well and he was going to see his doctors almost once a week but he is on the mend now. Which is a really good thing.  I was involved in a car accident while on duty and it really messed my back up so I have been fighting with those issues also. But besides all that I am using the MyTouch4G got a new team we are called TeamRoyal, and we have around 7 or so Roms out all in BiffMod fashion. Thanks for the email.

Yeah rick,

I also talked to Mike today also. I have been doing volunteer work at church lately building a website for the staff. I also described to him what I told you cause he brought it up. The light by the memorial gardens didn't even turn on for me when I went by it while locking up. I gave mike a description of the flashlighta and for security what needs to be installed in the back to light it up. Even if we get some lights back there I still think having 1 or 2 flashlights will be necessary.  I will pick up the flashlights and you / the church can reimburse me. Thanks Rick.

God Peace

Hey Glenn and Dave,

This is David, Clark's son in law. Clark told me to write you and advise you of the price for the out of state elk hunting tag and the price for the cost of the license. The Arizona out of state hunting license is $151.25 and the price for the Arizona out of state Elk tag is $595.00.  Which, if we dont get drawn, is refundable. The $595 is refundable besides $5.00, I am not sure about the $151.25 it might be, it might not be. The deadline to turn our application to Game and Fish is February 8th.  Refunds will be sent out on April 22nd. Now we will be mainly be putting in for Cow (Antlerless) Elk, the hunt date for Unit 8 (which is right out side of Williams, AZ) is from Dec 2nd, 2011 - Dec 8th, 2011.  Its a great area to hunt.  Let Clark know if you guys want to go so we can put your names on the application. Thanks!

    Also, I just talked to Aaron, and he said he talked to the registered owner of the vehicle (the driver's mother) and she told him that her vehicle has been uninsured for several months because she can not afford to pay the premiums.  The vehicle is currently in storage at property and evidence (behind KS) and we are not able to get into that vehicle without a search warrant, and because the vehicle insurance falls under civil law and not criminal, a search warrant will not be granted.  Your attorney can pursue a court order, but that's really about the best we can do.

Hey David,
First off I want to start off saying that I am truly blessed to have a friend like you.  I have never had a close friendship like this since my brother died and I honor and cherish our friendship. With that said let's get to the meat and potatoes of this email....
About the stuff we talked about on Wed. I want to say that I was not freaked out at all.  I am not the smartest person in the world so my first reaction was to just lend an ear for my friend and just listen, so I did. But also I need time to process what has been going on in your life. I also was very upset and worried that my friend (brother) was going through this.  So after having time to process it I came up with these conclusions (they might sound a little repetitive cause we already discussed it and you wrote me a letter, jerk): as a DRE I agree with the conclusion that because you have lost so much weight the higher dose of drug is now causing side effects.  That sounds very logical to me. Now for the spiritual side God as you know does not cause confusion so any feelings of that nature would be coming from the Devil. The devil is using this drug inbalance as a way to attack you.  The thoughts and actions you were having were all good signs that you were under attack and to that I pray for you. I am very glad that the doctor has lowered your dosage cause that will help the logical side and that you have told people about what has been going on in your life we will be praying for you and that will help the spiritual side.
I want you to know I am here for you and if and whenever you begin to fall into that dark spot again I am here for you.  I am your support I want you to call me immediately when you feel it coming and I will drop everything and anything I am doing and I will come to be with you and help you.  Even if it just means to go grab a beer and listen to you talk. Or if we just have to go for a drive where we don't talk I am here.  I agree we need to have a word or saying that you can gtalk, text or call me that you and I only know what it means and we will meet somewhere or I can come pick you up and we can work through whatever you are going through.  We will get you through this and when you do you will be a better and stronger man. Thank you again for sharing what has been going on in your life. 
Now to help you in another way, with your paranoia situation you told me about which is in no doubt affecting your marriage in some way.  Amy once told me that she had a conversation with Liane, and Liane told her that she worries about the same thing with you. She told Amy that you will tell her that you will be home in 20 min and then you will show up an hour and half later with no reason. Which with Liane must be affecting your marriage so there is two things that is hurting you guys. With you I am praying and hoping that with the medicine change your paranoia will go away now to help you with Liane you need to be more honest (not saying you aren't) but you need to keep her updated on where you are and what you are doing. Wives are always afraid that us as men are going to find a newer and younger woman so we as husbands need to make sure our wives know that they are the only ones for us and there is no way another woman will take us away from them. I let Amy know what I am doing every day. If I need to change what I am doing I let her know. If I am not going to home on time I let her know.  I so hope this paragraph does not offend you and hurts our relationship, as your brother I just felt you should know what I hear. Trust me bro I know how it is, we as husbands need to make our wives feel special and make them feel that there is nobody else.
Now to change the subject, lol, which if you want to cut and paste (yes Android has that option...dumb Microsoft) to another email so you can read it to Liane you can.  Amy and I were thinking about the money and this is what we came up with:
We are so very blessed to call you friends, God has blessed us in many ways, but one of the biggest things he has done for us has been giving us you as our friends. For years we have been praying for friends that share our faith and that we could be close to. It's an amazing feeling to know that we've found that in you.  Its not very often we are able to do something really nice for our friends, so we are happy that we've been able to give you the TV and Entertainment Center.  However we don't want you to ever feel indebted to us for any reason so we'll accept what we think is reasonable and you can take the rest.  You guys are awesome and we are blessed to call you friends.

Your Friend Gods Peace,
David

Damn that was long, (that's what she said) my fingers are killing me (that's what she said) typed the whole thing on my phone. Lol.

Hey Seve I am forwarding you the facebook email I got from my friend Angela Stevens, she is the Border Patrol Agent I was telling you about. Like she says in the message give her a call and she can help you out.  She is an awesome person and a great friend.   When you call her just tell her that your the friend I told her about, she will know who it is. Trust me she is a great girl. Listen to what she says.

Let me know how it goes Bro, we need to go for coffee again and/or play some Black Ops again,

Forwarded Message from Facebook:

Hey you, I am doing well! How are you? I hope you are healing up efficiently. And I am stoked you got DK back! As it should be! About your buddy....I am not sure what the email means other than perhaps he is moving through the process. Did the letter say he passed the test. As far as I know, the results come back pretty quick stating whether you pass or not. I am wondering if the two are unrelated, the email he got and him passing talking the test Like did he request information somewhere else? If he wants to, he can call me with any questions and maybe we can sort through what he has going on. He should be notified of an interview date if he passed the written test. One thing I thought I hears id they closed the opening because they had enough applicants. But again, who knows....have him give me a shout.

Take care out there buddy! Be safe!

and i'm glad we shared that whole thing together too - i'm still processing all of it.  Mimi covering her face as we lit up.  Jay and Kirk singing, Duggy, Duggy, Duggy, Duggy, Dug, Dug in their gay and lesbo friendly room, the cigars - they seriously rocked it.  The list goes on and on.  I'm thinking we probably should give the ladies at least a ladies night out here pretty soon.  Thanks man - I can't wait until next year!

Here's the info you need:

Manual server configuration:
SMTP Server: 	smtp.davidbrinkman.org
SMTP Port: 	587
POP Server: 	pop.davidbrinkman.org
POP Port: 	110
Outgoing Server Requires SMTP Authentication

Then in your gmail, go to settings, accounts and import, click on send from another account.  Your username and password is your full email address in the subject line and the password for your matrix youtube account.  Don't do SSL Security.  Use Google's SMTP Server when you're given that option.  I think those were all the options I had to do (I had to play with it a little bit to make it work - TWSS)

If you can't get it to work, let me know and I can set it up for you quick.  I'll work on those graphics today/tonight and get them in the post.  IMHO, the videos should be at the top and the write up below it.  I usually like to watch a video, but won't always scroll through text to see that there is a video at the end, and would miss a video review if it's at the end of text.

Also, I'll work on getting a search feature on the site - noticed that there's no real way to do that with this new theme.

Yes it is unfortunate I thought it was higher. But now knowing what I know I will take your advice and up it. Anyways my state farm insurance policy number is 525 5141-B02-03M. Let me know if you need anything else or if you don't get the police report I can make sure you get a copy.

> David, the other driver's insurance policy has a limit set by the policy agreed upon by the other driver and his carrier, and the per-person limit could be either $15,000 (minimum required), $25,000, $50,000, $100,000, or $300,000, or possibly more but not likely in almost all cases. Most often I see that policy limits are $25,000 and $100,000. At this time we do not yet know the name of the other driver's carrier but as soon as we do we will contact the carrier and ask them to disclose what the limits are on the policy. If I had to guess the amount of the limit of her policy in this case, I'd say it most likely would be $25,000. But I'm just guessing. As soon as we find out I'll let you know what it is.
>
> Right now, with what little information we currently have regarding your injuries, my guess is that your case is worth (case worth = your compensatory damages) a minimum of $50,000, and it could be much more depending on several factors that will have to be determined later on when we obtain more information.
>
> If the other driver's insurance policy limit per-person is less than the amount of your compensatory damages (case value), then we would want to consider two options: (1) initiating an underinsured motorist (UIM) claim with your auto insurance carrier if you have UIM coverage on your policy, and/or (2) a claim against the Jaguar Strip Club under dram shop law if it appears the driver was over served by the Club. Option (1) may not be an option if you do not have UIM coverage on your policy, but if you do, this option is preferable and your premiums should not increase as a result (probably around 50% or so of all our personal injury cases involve UIM claims). If you have UIM coverage, option (1) may not be preferable to option (2) if you end up needing surgery on your neck and/or you suffer a disability causing you to have to medically retire (essentially there ends up being really huge damages). While we would expect option (2) to be one of high insurance policy limits, if they have dram shop insurance, this option might be full of problems we are not yet aware of (i.e., the other driver drank at places other than the Jaguar Strip Club, the other driver smoked pot that night, the other driver was not intoxicated enough for it to be obvious to the bar tender that they were over serving her, etc.). Also, if we were to file a lawsuit against the Jaguar Strip Club, we would have to do so before November 3, 2011, as dram shop time limit for filing is one year, instead of two years for a lawsuit against the other driver (deadline: November 3, 2012). Do you have UIM coverage?
>
> At this time you have what is called an insurance claim, without a lawsuit being filed. When you've finished treatment and recovery from your injuries we will collect all needed records and information and complete our evaluation of your case and prepare what we call a demand packet, that will include a demand letter (usually several pages in length) and supporting documentation, records, and the demand letter will state a certain amount of money demanded for settlement. The insurance company would then have up to 30 days to review the demand packet and contact us to discuss their assessment and hopefully present us with an initial settlement offer. And then the settlement negotiations begin.
>
> It is too soon for us to consider the option of filing a lawsuit against the other driver (or even the Jaguar Strip Club). First, we'll need to find out what the other driver's policy limit is for you, and we may find that out before the end of December. Second, we'll need to find out the full extent of your damages and we won't know this until you are near completion of medical care and your recovery, and this may take another several months at least.

Dr. Datta really didnt say anything about the chiropractic treatment, but I will contact Dr. Datta's office to find out more information. Dr. Shand did not take any X-rays he said the CAT scan would suffice and he would leave if I need other X-rays to my main doctor (Dr. Herring) or the specialist (Dr. Datta). Dr. Datta did take at least 4 X-rays at my visit, 2 of my lower back and 2 of my neck. Dr. Shand has been adjusting me, which includes manipulating my neck along with electric stimulation. Also just a reminder I got that CAT scan on the day of the collision on November 3rd. Dr. Datta stated he is going to have to contact Saint Joe's Hospital and have them amend the report because they missed it. No I haven't not done any work at all from Nov 3rd - present. I have been on industrial leave. My Sergeant does not want to see me back to work until I am feeling 100%, he doesn't want me to re-injure myself. So I have been sitting at home doing nothing. I actually cant imagine me being at work right now cause sometimes the pain is so bad I cant even move.
> I did have a question on how this lawsuit will proceed. I've never really dealt with anything like this, so I'm curious how the insurance will be handling it. I know that when you buy an insurance policy, you have a maximum payout per person if you're involved in a collision. So I guess my question is, when a lawsuit is filed, does the payout that's on the insurance policy get voided and then a settlement is agreed on? I hope I worded that so you can understand my question.

Please let me know the name of the physical therapy clinic. Did Dr. Datta have any comment to you about the chiropractic treatment you've been receiving? Has Dr. Shand been manipulating your neck?

He is requesting that I start Physical Therapy 3x a week for at least 6 weeks. He is also wanting me off work so I can heal. I will be seeing him again in 2 - 3 weeks for a follow up. I will also be seeing my main doctor in 2 -3 weeks for another follow up. I am still going to the Chrio 3x a week for adjustments, The chiro also has me started going to the masseuse in his office 1 time a week to help with the muscle en-flamation and tension. I right now am looking to be out of work until the beginning of the year. Just trying to give you an update, Let me know if you need anything else.

Hey T-mobile Twitter,

This is Royalknight6190 but my real name is David Cesolini. My tmobile cell phone number is 480-278-3152 and here is my situation.  

First on November 3rd I was involved in a collision, on duty, I am a Highway Patrol Officer, I was rear ended by a drunk driver while parked on the side of the road.  My wife knew I have been wanting the MyTouch 4G since I heard about it. So with everything that occurred she decided to surprise me and get me the MyTouch4G.  So on November 9th she went into the Tmobile store by our house. Tmobile store number #268 (address: 990 E Riggs Rd, Chandler AZ 85249, Store Phone #480-895-6965).  When she got to the store she was expecting to pay what I have been telling her would be my upgrade price of $179.99 and then we would pay 3 payments of $40.00. Upon entering the store, she told the sales rep that she wanted to get me the MyTouch4G in red. They were unaware that the phone was even available in red and she had to point out the display that they had put out and tell them that the phone, did in fact, come in red. After looking through their inventory, they could not find a red phone, so they offered a red case for the 4G, and they would credit the account for the price of the case, so she would essentially get a free case for the phone. My wife agreed to this, so the sales rep (with the help of the manager) started to ring up the purchase. After looking up our account and scanning the phone, they advised my wife that she would be paying $151.67 in store, then the rest of the balance would be paid out over the next three months. Once my wife heard this she was really excited because she was going to be able to surprise me and help turn my bad week around, and she was going to have to pay less upfront. At this point, the sales rep had her slide her Bank of America Debit card and she entered her pin. Then the sales rep was trying to put the remaining balance as a delayed payment and it wasn't working. So he had to back out of the transaction. The problem was our Bank account still got charged the $151.67.  The store manager told her and reassured her that our account is not charged cause nothing went through. However, my wife called the bank (while in the store, if front of the manager and sales rep) and verified that our bank account had been charged the $151.67.  My wife and our three young children had to sit at the store for three hours as the manager tried to get our money back or to make the transaction happen. After three hours, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do anything and assured my wife that once he closed out his register at the end of the night, the bank would see that the transaction never went through and the money would not be taken out. So my wife left the store with no phone but $151.67 of our money was gone. My wife was very distraught because not only did she waste her whole afternoon, waiting in the store with our three kids, to walk out with nothing but missing money in our account, but she also missed a class that she's enrolled in. 

The following morning, we checked our bank account to find that not only did the charge not come off, but that it was no longer in pending status and had hard posted to our account. So we went to Bank of America that morning and they advised us that they cant do anything cause the charge went through and Tmobile has the money.  They printed off our statement so we could have proof that the charge was final and that there was no reversing it. They also told us that we could dispute the charge, but there was no guarantee that we would receive the money back immediately. So my wife and I decided that we would try to resolve the problem through Tmobile, hoping to get it taken care of a little faster. So we went to back to the Tmobile store and J, the store manager, said he had sent out the necessary emails to different people and had made the calls and they are working on it.  I advised him that this is not right, that Tmobile has $151.67 of my money and I don't have anything to show for it. I requested that he give me the cell phone my wife was buying in the first place and when the situation is resolved then either I can return it or pay for it. He said he can not do that because if Tmobile comes in and audit's the store, then he would be missing a handset and they would get shutdown. So yet again I left the store with no money and no handset. 

 The next day, November 11, we received a call from J saying that they can not resolve the situation, they don't know where the money went but they don't have it and that it must be a problem with the bank. So there is nothing he nor anybody else can do for us. I called Tmobile customer care and all she did was tell me that she can not do anything it has to do with the store and my bank. She gave me Tmobile's merchant ID and said I need to contact my bank.  I asked to talk to supervisors and never got transfered to any. 

To all this I am very upset. I am right now, out $151.67 and I don't have a new cell phone.  I advised the store manager that my wife is going to be needing a new cell phone and she will want the Mytouch4G also so we are going to be giving his store business. But it seemed like he didn't care. This is the worst customer service I have ever seen by Tmobile in all my years of being with them. Yes, this line I am on has only been open for 1.5 years but I was with you guys on a different line for many years.  This is uncalled for. I should've left that store with a handset until this situation was resolved and Tmobile saying they don't know where my money is scares me a lot. 

I contacted my bank and they said they will look into it but they said it could take up to 90 days. So that is 90 days I am out of my money. Also, until this whole thing is resolved, I don't feel comfortable upgrading my phone. So I am out my money, with no phone, and no hope of getting my new phone for quite some time. I know this can be resolved. I know there is something Tmobile can do. So please help me resolve this. My wife is very upset that she was trying to be nice and sweet and now she caused this big issue.  You may call me anytime and please do. I would love to speak to somebody about this.

Your supp looked really good.  I made a few small corrections that you can look at such as adding the DR # and a punctuation mark or two, but nothing substantive.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Also the code for FMLA is 00063 and your hire date is 03/27/2004.  I can't find your hourly rate.  If you go to the DPS website and look under Human Resources, there is a listing of all the job titles.  Just find the one for Officer and it will tell you your annual wages at least...possibly the hourly wage as well.

Take care,

Hey David,

Annie Wolf just gave me a phone call about a new member who has a son.  I guess the mother just went through a divorce her name is Daniele Hagerty (That was married name, doesn't know if she changed her last name)  Anyways her sons name is Alex.  Alex is a senior at Chandler High School, He plays football.  Annie believes that Alex needs some good male role models in his life. Also the mother was asking about Youth Group for her son.  So I am not going to be at Youth Group tonight cause I am working but I was thinking if you wanted to give them a call and give them a formal invite, that would be awesome.  I will be back to youth starting next week. Just cant make it this week. Sorry.  Anyways there phone number is 480-528-7594, Annie said if the 480 doesn't work try 602 instead, lol.  Thanks David for doing this.

Gods Peace

David

Hi!

I've just created biffmod user on GitHub and pushed BiffMod app there. I've also added RoyalKnight6190 as contributor (I assume it's you =o)))

Password of biffmod user on GitHub is xdaBiffM0d (that's zero not o ) Please do not change it for couple of days so I can create another repo for rest of files needed to build BiffMod from CM setup and will try to write something on how to use this (it's not hard just a few quirks)

FINAL VERSION

Alright guys. Sorry I haven't responded yet, I've been thinking and praying for the last 2-3 days between reading messages, trying to figure out what my 2 cents would be... and here it is... 
Just to let you know, I've been in contact with Tyler, Corey, Tonee and Kevin, which besides Dan, are the only youth left still in HS from previous years. Each of them (besides Kevin at this point) said that they would like to sit together at church Sunday morning and then have a Sunday morning youth group, then come back for a social time at 6. That shows me some dedication from these guys, so that's a good thing.
I know that any change that we decide on is going to be big, and will probably be a little rocky while we get any kinks ironed out, but I think that change is exactly what we need. When we have youth coming, then deciding to leave the church because we aren't meeting their needs, that just doesn't sit right with me. 
When deciding on our plan of action, we first need to decide on what our goal is for our youth. Here is what I think: 
We need to challenge the kids to dig deeper into their faith. We can't set our standards low for them. We need to challenge them to think about what it is they believe and we need to give them the tools to figure it out. We need to be a support and good role models to them so they know what it is to be Chrst Like.  I think by having a study on Sunday mornings and enforcing how important it is to go to church, we will be ingraining good life choices in the kids. We need to be those good role models for the kids, because some of them don't have that kind of dedication to church being shown to them by anyone else. Also, it might be easier for parents to transport the kids if they're already at church themselves. We might see an increase just from that. I think the more the kids are challenged, the more interested and dedicated they will be.  I like the idea of doing follow up questions or discussions from the sermon, just so the kids learn how to get more out of it, but I just want to make sure the kids will enjoy it. If we create normal or boring Bible studies for them, just so we have something to do, we're failing them. We need to think out of the box so we aren't just another youth group. That doesn't sound fun, or like something teens are going to want to join, which brings me to my second goal...
We need to creat an environment that the kids will have fun and will not be embarressed to invite their friends to. We can achieve that by having the Sunday night social time. We can start the time together by doing something lightly spiritual in the beginning, then go on to have a lot of fun activities planned for the kids. We definitely can't have a disorganized mess on Sunday nights. We should have it planned that we'll have our 15 min. of praise or skits, etc. then have an activity planned, like walking to a coffee house, or ice cream, board games, etc. By creating this fun social time, the youth can invite their friends and not be embarressed. Hopefully, that would lead to some friends even joining us on Sunday mornings. 
We have 40+ HS students in our church. Why are we only seeing a quarter of that? We need to make changes. Even if we try it for awhile and don't see a change, at least we TRIED. I don't think our numbers will go any lower, so something needs to be done to try to raise them. We need to reach the kids who are just tagging along with their parents on Sunday mornings and don't really have their own faith. Or the kids who are searching for something, and don't even know we exist at their own church. We have some talented kids and I think we need to tap into that and get some of them to make announcements on Sunday mornings, so it gets the word out there that we are here and we're looking to enjoy and support our teens.
I agree that a College group needs to be started, but until that happens our kids need a place to go. I know there's other places out there, but if they aren't willing to go to those other places, they need to know that they're welcome to join us until we get their own study set up. They need us just as much as the younger youth do and if they're college group isn't started before our new session starts, we will make sure that they understand that they will be role models to our younger youth and they need to be respectful of that. 
I agree on the service projects being put into each kids fund.  So if one kid doesnt want to help then when it comes to trip time that kid will have to pay full cost unlike a kid that has helped out all year.  But we need to let the parents know this is how its going to be then the parents will help push the kids to go and help us on service projects.
Yes this new way might be a bumpy road at first but there is 4 of us not including PDB, who I think and feel have shared an interest in helping,  so between all of us and our busy schedules we still should be able to put together a great new and improved program that will Rock this 2010/2011 year and carry on into the future.  We are here for the kids, so remember that.  DJ has already done a lot of the leg work by making a great schedule of Bible Studies so now we need to sit down all together and make a list of how the study will go and what questions to ask, things like that.  Also we need to get out there and get the 40+ High school students that are in the church that dont come we have dropped the ball there by being happy with are normal small 10+ kids. That is unacceptable we have 40+ HS students we should have 40+ HS in group, lets shoot for that.  
I'm excited for this year to start and I'm praying that we can all come up with an awesome plan that will bless our youth!
Gods peace,
DC

How about this??



Anna has loved going to school at Risen Savior. She is constantly coming home and amazing us with her reading ability among all the other things she’s learning and excelling at. She has such a passion for learning and loves utilizing what she learns at school in all the other areas of her life. Even more important than her academic achievements, our whole family has been blessed by her spiritual growth. Her understanding of her faith has grown and it brings tears to our eyes as she teaches her sister and brother about Jesus. She definitely has a strong faith in her savior and she expresses it through prayer. She prays with confidence and her first reaction to many things (good or bad) is to pray. Recently, my husband, who is a police officer for the State of Arizona, was injured while on duty. He has been on leave from work due to the injuries he sustained after getting hit by a drunk driver. Anna has prayed many times thanking God for keeping her Daddy safe and she is always telling her family to be praying that Daddy gets better so he can go back to work. Her faith often times reminds us to keep our focus on God, even while dealing with the stress that comes with having a parent who is injured.

Our family has gone through a lot within the last year and a half, due to our youngest son being diagnosed with a chronic illness called Cystic Fibrosis. There are many doctor appointments and medical treatments that have altered our daily routines and even affected our living situation. In an effort to be closer to our son’s doctors and good medical care, we had to leave our house and many friends in Arizona City and move to Chandler. It was not an easy thing to do, but we had to make sure that we were doing everything we could to insure our son will live the healthiest life possible, despite his condition.

We can’t help but see the blessings God has given us through these tough times. We never would have imagined being able to send our daughter to a Christian school, yet we were able to through the help of scholarships, and I truly believe that has been one of the biggest blessings that we could ever have.

We are so very proud of the young lady Anna is developing into and we know that without the help of scholarships, there would be no way we would be able to have such an amazing experience.

Hey Honey!
   I hope you had a great night working on your website. It looks AWESOME!  You're doing such a good job on it and it looks like a lot of people like it. The only suggestion that I have is to think about that Christian example you setting. Hon, in no way is it ok to have half naked women as wallpapers. You have a ton of other wallpapers, and if someone wants to pollute their phone by putting women on it, then they can find it somewhere else. I'm kind of tired of always seeing these images popping up. It's totally disrespectful towards women and you are promoting something that (I hope) you would be totally disgusted by if your daughters ever chose to take pictures of themselves like that. I honestly don't think you will get any more people visiting your site just because of those wallpapers, so there's no reason to have them.
   Sorry about venting on an email, but if I don't say it this way, I may never say it because of how crazy it is around here and there's a serious lack of conversation time available to us for things like this. I love you, hon.

Hey everyone out there!
 
We, in Arizona, know you're boycotting us -- but you really should come out here and see
our Beautiful Sonoran Desert.
 
It's just gorgeous right now!  We know you'd love it and maybe you can share what you
saw with the rest of the country so they can love it too!
 
 
cid:25AF1950C4C5441B9E06DB009506DA8C@HKEY
 This is on an 'illegal super - highway' from Mexico to the USA (Tucson) used by human smugglers. 
This area is located in a wash, approximately 1.5 miles long, just south of Tucson, Arizona. If a
flood came, all this would be washed to the river and then onto the sea!
 
 
 
cid:E5F9CAE5862F4856AA9A93BBBF00C92E@HKEY
 It is estimated over 5,000 discarded backpacks are in this wash.  Countless water containers,
food wrappers, clothing, feces, including thousands of soiled baby diapers. And as you can
see in this picture, fresh footprints leading right into it.
 
 
cid:7342F8C07EC24483939716B0EBAFE172@HKEY
As we kept walking down the wash, we thought for sure it was going to end, but around
every corner was more and more trash!  
 
 
 
cid:C6AADE6AA64F4E0992908E0A5F866781@HKEY
  
And of course the trail leading out of the wash in our city, heads directly NORTH to Tucson,
then leads to your town tomorrow.
 
 
cid:9A0433DC82B84E0D991F22B5896DA958@HKEY
  
They've already come through here. Isn't Arizona just beautiful, America?
Why would you boycott us???  Our desert has basically been turned into a landfill.
 
 
 
cid:064B782C609A43A798D3AF40BEA08937@HKEY
The trash left behind by people illegally crossing our border is another Environmental Disaster to hit the USA. 
If these actions had been done in one of our Northwest Forests or Seashore National Parks areas,
there would be an uprising of the American people.....but this is the Arizona-Mexican border.
 
You won't see these pictures on CNN, ABC, NBC or the Arizona Republic Repugnant newspaper.  Nor will
they mention the disease that comes from the uncovered human waste that was left in our desert.
 
However, with respect to CNN, ABC & NBC, they do offer us Special Reports on cheating celebrity spouses....

This information needs to be seen by the rest of the country.

Hello everyone! This has been a crazy month after finding out that David is getting a K9 position. We've gone house shopping in Arizona City (which is right outside of Casa Grande.) We still don't have a move date, which is a little frustrating, but we know we won't get there until God wants us there. Well, as it happens, we found a house, and this afternoon we were going to make an offer on it. An hour before our meeting with our realtor, we got a phone call from David's new sgt, asking us if we would consider going to Yuma instead. He didn't want an answer right away, but said to call him back on Monday. Of course, I would still love to move to Arizona City, but at the same time, I know that we need to keep our minds and hearts open to where God wants us. If you could keep us in your prayers this weekend, asking God to give us a clear path to go down, so we end up where we can do His will. It would be so easy to say forget about Yuma, we want AZ City, but we know that our lives are not our own, and that we should do God's will. Like I said, we have to answer by Monday, so I will write back and let everyone know what was decided. Please continue to pray for us, and thank you for all the prayers that have been said. I hope everyone has an enjoyable and safe weekend!
Love and God's Peace,
Amy :)

I know, I know... it's been awhile once again with the pictures... Anna just hasn't been that cute lately! Of course, I am just kidding. If anything, she's been more and more cute every day! With that, she's been getting into more and more mischief every day, hence why it's harder and harder to get on the computer to send pics. Not only that, but David is working nights now, and seeing that I need his phone to get on the internet, and it's easier to get on the computer after Anna goes to sleep... well... you get the picture. Anyways! Enough excuses!!  Anna has become quite the artist lately, and LOVES coloring in her coloring books. So far she has been pretty good about keeping it in her books... there's only been a couple of times when we've had to take her crayons away. She has also fallen in love with taking pictures of herself, so now whenever the camera comes out, she practices her smile. As you can tell, it looks very natural.... I hope everyone is having a wonderful Christmas season!
Love,
Amy :)

It sounded pretty good... read this and call me to tell me what you think.

Love ya

Amy :)


My name is David Cesolini and I am currently on the 310 squad after leaving K-9’s back in March. As I was leaving K-9’s, Captain Leos suggested that I send you an email once I got settled into Metro, concerning the possibility of me getting into the computer forensics squad. He advised me that he’s already spoken to you concerning this matter. I was wondering if I could get any information about your squad and maybe come by one day to do a ride along with your squad, possibly even do a 90 day detail. My squad is switching days off right now to Wednesday through Friday, so any of those days work for me. I already have my interest card in for your squad and am looking forward to the opportunity to get to know more about the squad.

Thank you,

Hey Bro,

I agree I was at church today and while Pastor Jim was talking, it was weighing on my heart and soul and I was standing there thinking I am a terrible person and should I even be in this spot of leadership at the church.  It also got me to thinking on when my spiral down hill started and yet again it was when I joined K-9's and I let them change me and I let myself get changed so I would fit in.  I know that isn't any excuse and I am not trying to make an excuse cause I know it was all me.  I let myself get changed cause I wanted to fit in and probably cause I needed that and was looking for that friendship that I lost so long ago.  But its just another good reason why I left K-9 cause hopefully I can get back to the person that I used to be.  Then it got me to thinking about the friendship that has grown since coming to RS, and that God has granted me such an awesome friend (I am talking about You, hahaha) that can keep me in line and watch my back.  and how much I honor our friendship and enjoy our friendship.  I haven't had that since my brother passed.

Since we talked about X3watch on that one day with that nasty bottle of Rum I was very hesitant to put it on my computer cause there are others that use this computer and I didn't want that coming up in discussion yet on what it is.  Cause I have not hit that point yet to tell Amy that I have visited bad sites. I don't do it all the time but it is like you said I get ashamed and then don't do it for awhile then come back.  So I agree, I yet again also need you to be there and watch my back and keep me accountable on what sites I am visiting.  I think I also didn't install it right away cause I do cherish our friendship I didn't want to do anything that would effect it, like having you see the sites that I have visited.  But today at church I hit that point that I need you there to watch my back and keep me accountable.

So I just woke up from my slumber and came down stairs and installed x3watch and you are my single person so enjoy and make sure if I do visit any site that is bad you can take me out back and beat the shit out of me. Just like you said you may call me out anytime on any site that I visit.  I don't know if it will flag my gaming sites that use naughty language but go ahead I will explain. (hahaha) (sorry needed to bring some humor into this email)  Thanks again for being there for me.

the other,

D.


(I just realized we are a pair of Double D's)

Hey Sharon and Diane,

Well DK and I had a busy day yesterday.  First off yes Sharon 3818 will be perfect. ok now to what occurred yesterday.  We stopped a vehicle on I-10 at MP 201 W/B. while I was talking to the Driver I smelled the strong odor of raw marijuana and saw 2 bundles of marijuana behind the driver seat.  I got the driver out and arrested her. During the Probable Cause search and after I let DK do her job I located a total of 30 bundles with a total weight of 369.5 lbs of Marijuana.  It was a very good day.  Hope you enjoy the pictures. Have a great Easter. He is Risen.

    Sharon,
       Your nice words also bring tears to my eyes as I read that. I am glad that I have had this opportunity to honor Doug and your family. I feel as though it's been a huge blessing that the Lord has given me. We're getting really excited about the baby too. Only a few more weeks, which Amy is happy about because she's starting to get uncomfortable. Her due date is May 3rd.
       I am able to order as many badges as you want. It doesn't matter if it's family or not. I do have to pay for my own, but I'm not expecting you to pay for mine or D.K.'s, unless it's something you really want to do, in which case we will be grateful.
       Just so I have an accurate count of how many you want, I will be ordering 5 badges for you and your family, right? If you can't think of anyone else, then I will pass that along to Sgt. Shull and I will get you a total of how much it will cost and when he needs the money.
    I'll talk to you soon.
    David

        I am not sure how many badges you can get......I would buy one for Doug's parents, Misty, Justin, myself and Diane if non-family members can have one.  I know badges can be weird sometimes.  I will pay for DK's badge and yours if you have to pay.  What an honor!

        Hey Sharon, Misty and Diane,

        Sorry I haven't wrote in a long time but it has been very crazy around my house lately.  Everybody has been sick numerous times, we are getting everything ready to have this baby, and we've been pretty busy with church.  So here is the run down with pictures and all the D.K. news.  First D.K. and I recertified in March for Patrol Work, She did awesome, one of the best dogs out there she was on her A game.  We just stopped a Car two weeks ago and located 95.5 lbs of Marijuana in boxes that were being prepared to ship to Porta Rico.  It was an excellent find.  Back in Feb. we stopped a Semi truck loaded with 105 lbs of marijuana and $5000 cash.  Now, Sgt. Shull is taking orders for K-9 badges. They are going to be around $35 each.  They will be a full size badge, just flat. D.K.'s name will go on it with either my badge number or Doug's Badge number. With your permission, Sharon, I would like the one I order for myself to have Doug's badge number on it. Please let me know as soon as possible if you would like any badges for yourself.
        Hope everything is going well with all of you and that the 100 club banquet went well.
        Talk to you soon.
        David

Hey Sharon,
Each badge is $35.00, plus $1 shipping, so a total of $36 per badge which comes out to a total of $288. Sgt. Shull would like to place the order by May1st. You can make the check out to John Shull, because he is then going to be writing out one check to the company. If you're at work today, I can swing by and pick up the check from you, because I'll be coming into Phoenix today to get my AC checked. If you aren't we'll figure out another way to get the check down here. Just give me a call and let me know.

That is terrific! Sometimes we all overdo a little – the four legged kids are just like us and strain things from time to time and are too proud to admit it.  Have a great vacation!

Subject: Update on DK

 

I am so sorry for not writing sooner on DK! We've been keeping a close eye on it, and for the past couple weeks she hasn't shown any sign of limping. The even better part is that within the last week, she's gotten more hyper, which tells me, that her leg MUST be feeling much better, because she hasn't been this hyper in a long time. She's running around the house and always wanting to play these last few days, it's been great seeing her back to herself! I almost forgot how hyper she can be!

   Thank you all for praying for us, it really did help!! Now, hopefully we can start getting more loads of the road! I go on vacation next week, so I'm hoping afer that we'll come back in full force and attack the road!

Yes, not having Valley Fever is a huge relief – I had a little girl that got Valley Fever (Mandie).  She took the same drugs a human would take.  It got to be a joke because anytime someone went to Mexico I would have them bring back drugs for my sweet girl.  She got lots of extra years of life, but the downside is it weakens their internal organs and she would up with heart problems when she was only about 8-9.

 

LOTS of rest the next 3 days!

Everybody,

 

Good news, the blood work came back negative for valley fever. So now we need to figure it out if she just has a sprain or if it's a pulled ligament. Luckily we have the next three days off, so she's going to be taking it easy.  We will see if she's still favoring it on Monday, and then we'll have to see if x-rays need to be done. I will definitely keep you all updated. I am just relieved that valley fever isn't a possibility anymore.

I'll talk to you all soon!

David

Well, we finally are out of that rut.  This was a very good seizure too. We seized 235 lbs of really fresh marijuana and $1000 cash.  D.K. did a good job in letting me get into the vehicle.  The driver gave me consent to search the vehicle, but like always I took D.K. (who is on light duty because she is injuried. I'll tell you about it later) and she alerted to the vehicle so I could search in more depth.  Which really, I didnt need to do because the 12 bundles of marijuana were just in the trunk.  Also, in my investigation I determined the driver was an illegal and he was using somebody's Social Security number and a completely different persons Resident Alien Card Number.  So I also put charges forward for Identity theft, forgery, and federal charges for having two false federal documents.  Now the detectives are not going to stop there. They are going to look into this case and see what they can dig up from the address the vehicle is registered to, so hopefully they will get more out of this stop.  So all together it was a very good stop.  Getting Marijuana and other drugs off the street is very good, but when you can determine that they are stealing somebodys identity which is destroying somebodys life, that is just great.

 

So, I noticed about two weeks ago that D.K. was limping on her back left leg.  So I told the trainer and he said just keep an eye on it because these dogs are so athletic that maybe during a jump she might have hurt something.  Well this week during training I noticed she really didnt want to jump much and was still favoring the leg, so I told the trainer again and he told me to bring her to the vet just to get everything checked out.  So the vet checked for Valley Fever which could cause muscle joint pain like she is having.  But with Valley Fever she should be getting fatigued more and not eating as much and she is not showing any signs like that, just the hurt leg.  So I should get the results back on that hopefully tomorrow.  The vet thinks it is going to be that she might have pulled a ligament in her knee joint. I,f that is the case, the vet said we would have to do x rays to check and then probably surgery.  Now he gave me pain killers for her to take and told me starting on Tuesday after work just let her lay around the house and be lazy and I told him ok.  He is hoping its just a sprained leg and with the help of the pain killers and being on light duty it will heal over the weekend.  He said  by next monday if she is still limping we probably should get her in for xrays and this is all depending if the valley fever test is negative.  If its positive then we get her on medication and we will work with the leg but if its negative and she is still limping it is going to be something else.  So keep her in your prayers. 

 

That's all we have for now. I will keep you updated on how D.K. is doing. Hopefully we will have it all figured out by next week. 

 

PS:  The last pic is where she alerted.  You can see her nice scratch marks.

Hey Sharon,
 
For thanksgiving we were just going to be going to Amy's parents house for the day, which is in Gilbert, but we can make a detour to come by and she your folks.  This weekend we don't have anything really planned. My parents are coming down today to spend the day but tomorrow is open.  So whatever day that would work out better for you, just let me know!
 
I totally think D.K. could help him respond better. Animals have a thing about them that brings happiness to us as people. Especially when we are sick or in pain.  So just let me know. 
 
I also tried to send you pictures of our load that we got last friday, but for some reason it failed, so I will attach some on this email so you have them.  Let me know about this weekend or Thanksgiving.
 
David

Well Everybody.
 
D.K. and I are at it again.  Today we made a traffic stop on a vehicle and noticed a lot of indicators of criminal activity.  I received consent to search.  I began to search found what I thought was a compartment.  I ran D.K. on the compartment area which was in the dashboard.  She alerted to the center console and the dashboard.  She knows better than me.  During the search we didnt find anything in the dash compartment that was constructed but we did find a center console compartment.  Inside the compartment we found 9 bundles of meth totaling 16 lbs of meth. we had a very busy day dealing with that but it was well worth it.  I hope everybody has a great rest of the day and a great a safe weekened.
 
1st pic is of the compartment with the meth in it.
2nd pic is a bundle of meth in the compartment.
3rd pic is a bundle of meth unwrapped and cut open.  The brown stuff is the wax.
4th pic is of another bundle of meth un wrapped, this time they used tupoware.
5th pic is of D.K. with the drugs. Trophy Shot
6th pic is of just the meth.
 
Love and God Bless,
 
David and D.K.

Ok everyone,
 
I am so sorry this took me forever to get out.  But D.K. and I just have been extremely busy with work and of course playing and family duties.  But here are the pictures from are last load we got that I called you all on.  The first three pictures are of the marijuana that we seized out of the vehicle a total of 201.5 lbs.  The next two pictures are of the marijuana we seized out of the house after the car a total of 234 lbs.  Which gave us a grand total for the day of 435.5 lbs of marijuana along with seizing a vehicle and making three arrests.  Not a bad days of work if you ask me.
 
Today we drove into phoenix for a few hours to assist a task force who need D.K. to sniff a vehicle that possibly could've had money or drugs in it.  She did not alert to the vehicle and during there Consent search did not find anything.  like D.K. told them. 
 
Sharon Sgt. Shull wanted me to ask you if the 100 club has anymore heat alarms to pass out for vehicles.  The heat alarm in the vehicle I am driving in right now is going bad and they don't make that model anymore so we are going to need to get a new one.  He was wondering if the 100 club still had some certificates for heat alarms if we could have one.  If I need to fill out a request form or anything just let me know.
 
Well I hope everybody has a safe weekend.

Hey Sharon and Diane,
 
Well the fourth week of training has come and gone. I can't believe it is already the fifth and final week of patrol school.  D.K. is just doing awesome. She just keeps getting better and better.  D.K. and myself will certify on Wednesday and Thursday of next week.  Then after we certify for patrol work, we have five more weeks of narcotics school.  My wife Amy came to training on Thursday and I had her take some pictures of D.K. doing the obstacle course and bite work. 
 
Also, Gil Valdez called me on Monday to let me know that D.K.'s vest should be in this week.  From what he was telling me, him and his son like to do a presentation ceremony.  I will talk to Lt. Leos about this once Gil Valdez calls me and lets me know the vest is in.  Once I find out more info on this, I will let you know.
 
Sharon, in your last email you asked about a heat sensor in my car.  Yes, my patrol car has a heat sensor in it.  It is one of the old ones, but the car is old, so that is ok.  I told Sergeant Marty Leopard and Sergeant John Shull that you had a Heat Sensor available.  So if and when I get my Chevy Tahoe, we can probably put the heat sensor from the 100 club inside the Tahoe, if that would be ok.
 
Just a quick rundown of the pictures...
1. D.K. climbing the six foot high barrels
2. Coming down the A-frame (about 7-8 ft high)
3. We have the dogs jump onto this barrel and sit. She does very good on this.
4. I'm giving her the command for stand
5. D.K. biting
6. I'm getting D.K. ready to go get a suspect
7. One more bite
 
Hope you enjoyed these ones! I'll be talking to you soon about the vests.
David

David:
 
We would like to catch you tomorrow if it works out.  I have a funeral dinner from noon to 1:00 in Mesa.  I do not know how long your meeting will go in the morning, but I might be able to just be seen and then leave the luncheon.  So, if you would call me on my cell, if it works out I will call Diane and we will both try to meet you at KS.  That would be cool to get a photo in front of KS.  Maybe we should do a media shot!  What do you think?  Probably should save it for when we get the vest and then do one.  I bet we could get a good story though DK being back at Knutson Station! :-)  Maybe some good PR for DPS and for the 100 Club.  People love animal stories.
 
Anyway, please call me when you are finished and hopefully we'll be able to hook up.  Diane is checking into the vest and of course you need the vent deal.  Do you have an alarm if the inside of your vehicle gets too hot?  We have a certificate for one from Arizona Emergency Products if you don't have one.
 
My cell:  602-418-5702.  If you don't get me right away, please try David's cell:   602-390-4662.
 
Thanks and looking forward to seeing you.

Sharon and Diane,
 
I talked to Sergeant Marty Leapord last night and he said we can order the vest now.  The website is www.protectpoliceK-9.com.  He told me what you need to do, is call and talk to Gil Valdez (Office Phone Number - (520) 326-4904 email address - Gil.Valdez@ProtectPoliceK-9.com)  who is the owner/founder of the orginzation and let him know that you are going to be buying/sponsering a vest for K-9 DK, whose handler is Officer David Cesolini with AZDPS.  I will fax them her measurments tonight when I get to work.  Sharon, I know you want the 100 clubs logo on the vest so you can discuss that with Gil Valdez, they also need two unit identification arm patches, which I will mail to them, or have one of the Tucson guys drop off.  Marty also told me that the vest comes in black or olive green (Swat color).  I do not have a preference on which color.  Black would be nice because it would blend in with her very well and look good.  The olive green would match our swat team, so if or when she becomes a swat dog, she could match the swat team.  Either one I will be happy with.  I will leave the decision to you and Diane. 
 
I dont know what kind of other things you want to buy DK.  One thing that came to mind, that I've seen other K9 officers have, is a thing called CoolK-9. It would help her stay cool while in the back of the patrol car. The website for it is www.coolcop.com/coolk9.html. I'ts a tube that, on one end connects to one of the AC vents and on the other end, it connects to the kennel and then DK will have a direct line of AC going to her instead of just the vents blowing in the cab.  That's really the only thing I can think of for now.
 
Also, if you ever wanted to come down and watch us train, you are more than welcome to. Just let me know ahead of time, so I can let you know the times of training. I will be coming up to Phoenix tomorrow for a district K-9 meeting at 1130 at Knutson Station.  Then after that we will be training in Mesa.  So If you wanted to meet DK this might be a good opportunity.  I can call you when I get done with the meeting and we can meet or you can come by the station. Just let me know!
 
DK's full grown weight will be roughly 70 - 75 lbs at the max.  I talked to Marty about if we will be having a graduation ceremony, he said we can do some kind of dedication ceremony like they did at the offficer's memorial.  Or, if you and Sharon want to throw something together that would be great too. When I spoke with Assistant Director Felix about a month ago, he mentioned to Director Vanderpool about having a ceremony, so I'm not sure if they have made any plans as of yet.
Feel free to call me with any questions 928-916-8177

    Hey Sharon and Diane,

    Just to give you a progress report with DK... We are startingour third week of Patrol School today. The past two weeks have been really great. DK is progressing wonderfully. The instructors and I see no issues with DK as of yet, and as long as everything continues to go well, she should be fully certifiedby mid August. She is searching and finding subjects in a perfect amount of time. She is not afraid to do things without me there. For example, we were doing a scenario where a subject was sitting on some pallets, about 7ft high, and she didn't hesitate to jump on boxes and tables to findhim. Some K-9's in the beginning are hesitant to do things like that without the handler right there encouraging them. She is learning how to track subjects and articles by their scent, which is known as wind scent. Her bite is really strong, which is good, she gives a full mouth bite, which is what we want. I am including a video taken on my cell phone of DK biting a running subject. I will continue to keep you updated, and I will try to get more photos of her working, as I am sure you will enjoy them.

Thanks for the info!  I'll add it to the tech roster.
 
To become an instructor, the best thing to do is to find an instructor to guide you through the process.  Go to this link for more information.  http://www.safekids.org/certification/instructor.html
 
My understanding is you'll need some letters of recommendation to apply.  You'll need to attend a 32-hour CPS Tech course and teach some of the modules.  Then during the child safety seat check, you'll check off the student technicians with an instructor checking your work.  I'm not sure if you have a written test to take when the class is done.
 
I can't find any instructors online in the Yuma area (which seems weird to me), but I'm sure Arnie Cuellar with GOHS would be willing to help you though the process.  His number is 602-255-3216, cell is 602-228-1837, Email is acuellar@azgohs.gov.  DPS Officer Jason Warren is also an instructor, but he's in Kingman.  His extension is 2032, his Email is azhwyptrl@policeone.com, his home phone is 928-208-8408, his cell is 928-303-9388.
 
Good luck!  Let me know if I can help you in any way.
 
Michelle
 
P.S.  Sorry it took so long to get back to you -- I went to training last week and then I've been trying to catch up so far this week!

Hey Sam,

Sorry it took me a little longer to write back this time I had a few
friends over on my days off and I didnt want to just leave them
hanging while I was in here typing to you.  Even though I really enjoy
writing you and getting to know you better.  So I think you said
school started for you on Wed. or Thurs.  and both days have come and
gone.  So how was your first day back to school?  You go to a charter
school right?  What kind of classes do you take?  Are you taking any
Photo classes?  Even though if you did you would be way more advanced
than most because of Dick's class.  Also you are such a great
photographer, You took some awsome photos I was very impressed.  I
wont keep you to long just in case you have HOMEWORK!!! :) Ha Ha Ha.
Today was kind of a busy day,  I had a 962 collision about an hour
after I checked 10-8 and then I had to meet a Insurance Claims
Adjuster who wanted to photograph two vehicles that were involed in a
963.  (I am pretty sure you understand DPS codes so that is why I just
use them without even asking first or explaining them.)  Then I went
to have Lunch and finally I was able to make two traffic stops until I
got called to another 962 up river in Parker which is 40 miles from
quartzsite.  before I left quartzsite the 1600 car checked 10-8 and he
lives in Parker so he took it, that was a funny call though he got
told to 10-22 and it wasnt a collision at all.  it turned out that
driver of the vehicle pulled over on the side of the road to
sleep...............underneath HIS
CAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what an idiot.  That is
the kind of people I deal with out here.  Anyways so how is your last
few days off before school started?  I hope you did some fun stuff.
Well I should be going.

Talk to you later

David

Hey David-

It's okay you took a little longer, I completely understand (with
school, it took me a couple days to respond, too).  I didn't really do
much the last few days of break, just getting ready for school and
watching movies (Jurassic Park, etc).  The first day (Thursday) was
good, meeting all my new teachers was fun and it looks like this year
is going to be good.  My classes are American Literature (English),
American Studies (History), Precalculus, Physics, French III, and
Ballet Corps.  Unfortunately, because my school's so small, we don't
really have any electives like photography-- otherwise I would be
taking that, too.  The homework hasn't been too bad, I've just been
really tired, trying to get used to waking up early again.  Your day
certainly sounded busy, between the accidents and the idiots (I can't
imagine how you would fall asleep under your car, that's just weird).
Using the DPS codes is fine, I had to learn them before they'd let me
go on ride-alongs, so I'm pretty familiar with them.  By the way, Dick
told my dad he'll be sending out the photos on Monday, so I should
have them sometime around next Wednesday.  Speaking of photos, I'll
attach the best one of the post (courtesy of my dad).  Left to right:
me, Josh, Chris, Joe, Paul, Ofc. Buck.

Have a good day, and be careful out there on the road.

Sam

you said you were going to email me, i thought i'd beat you to the punch.  again, thanks for listening.  i do trust you, despite my trust issues.  i wouldn't have told you anything if i didn't trust you.  i told you everything.  completely open book - nothing held back.  and did so because i wanted to give you insight to where my thoughts were going, when they've been going there.  it has freaked me out a little to be honest - i understand if it freaked you out.

i'll call if i need help.  i promise you that.  i will say the words i need help if it gets really bad.

i'm changing doses tonight.  as soon as i click send.  i'm wondering if the weight loss has had the effect of making the same dose more potent (like a heavy person can drink the same amount of alcohol as a light weight person and have a lower BAC).  i have less anxiety about changing the dose.  i wonder if now that i've lost 20% of my body mass, decreasing the dose will be like taking the higher dose when i weighed more.  i'm not sure it works exactly that way, but i feel better about changing it.

the money - seriously, do whatever you want to do with it.  keep it.  give it all back.  give some of it back.  i don't want it to create a wedge between us or our families.  i just know that you would have sold the entertainment center for sure.  it's beautiful.  and i am so thankful for the gift - every time i sit down to watch tv i am reminded of how awesome you guys are.

    Jeff:

    The Tribal Council has not really established clear criteria for the projects they will consider for the local gaming revenue sharing funds. In general they are looking for projects which are public and have tangible benefits to the public.

    The last contribution they made was to provide construction funds to the La Paz County Hospital for the new Emergency Room.

    I can't guarantee that the tribal council will approve the deal but I think we should give it a try.  At least we can get the town on the Tribal Council's radar screen for cooperation and contributions.

    I'm not sure. Is a redneck the same as a southerner?

    I talked to Dan Field about the project idea? Can you give some guidelines
    on what type of projects could qualify? He is very interested, of course.

            Are you a Democrat, Republican or Southerner?

            Here is a little test that will help you decide.

            The answer can be found by posing the following question:

            You're walking down a deserted street with your wife and two small
            children.

            Suddenly, an Islamic Terrorist with a huge knife comes around the
            corner,
            locks eyes with you, screams obscenities, praises Allah, raises the
            knife,
            and charges at you. You are carrying a Glock 40 Cal., and you are an
            expert
            shot. You have mere seconds before he reaches you and your family.
            What
            do
            you do?

            ......................................................................




            Democrat's Answer:

            Well, that's not enough information to answer the question!

            Does the man look poor! Or oppressed?

            Have I ever done anything to him that would inspire him to attack?

            Could we run away?

            What does my wife think?

            What about the kids?

            Could I possibly swing the gun like a club and knock the knife out of
            his
            hand?

            What does the law say about this situation?

            Does the Glock have appropriate safety built into it?

            Why am I carrying a loaded gun anyway, and what kind of message does
            this

            Is it possible he'd be happy with just killing me?

            Does he definitely want to kill me, or would he be content just to
            wound
            me?

            If I were to grab his knees and hold on, could my family get away
            while
            he
            was stabbing me?

            Should I call 9-1-1?

            Why is this street so deserted?

            We need to raise taxes, have a paint and weed day and make this
            happier,

            healthier street that would discourage such behavior.

            This is all so confusing! I need to debate this with some friends for
            few
            days and try to come to a consensus.

Dave,
 
You have a lot of work to do with this project, but it will be fun.  I really enjoyed the experience.  If you need any help at all, just call, anytime, I really would like to be involved if I can help.  I have a lot of ideas of what went good and what to change.  I am here for you the entire way through.  I think it is a great program and I want to see it continue with its success.  I am going to attach some of the documents I created.  I actually have a disk with everything on it. I will get  it to you, but it is to big to download.  Fell free to change any forms.  I have some stuff they did in D 1 that I really liked and would put into my next class.  I will also send you the graduation slide show I created.  It will give you and idea of what we did.  Petersen has a copy you can ask him for if you need it sooner.  When planning the class, keep the topics interesting, but informative.  remember, you are an embassador of our department.  The community members will look at the classes and make judgements about our entire department and law enforcement, based upon your actions, words, and demeanor, as well as the instructors you bring in.  Also remember, these people have volunteered their time, they don't have to be there, they want to.  My recommendation for now is to focus on:
 
1.  Dates/times
2.  Location
3.  Class schedule/ possible instructors
4.  Agencies involved
5.  Target dates for certain deadlines i.e. Apps due?, supplies due?, advertisements due?
6.  Marketing plan-how are you going to reach the people
 
Anyway, can you tell I am passionate about this?  Please use me as a reference.  I can steer you towards resources and ideas.  You will do great!
 
Chris

    Not for anyone with a weak stomach/heart etc…..

    How the Mexican Cartel gets rid of a body...........

     

    I am sure that Calderon realizes the problem does not lie within the borders of the United States.  He has a lot of cleaning up to do before he can come to this country to criticize about our reasons for being protective about the people the United States wants to allow into it's borders.  Truly disgusting!

     
     


     
    This file has pictures of what Mexican drug cartels do to eliminate dead bodies. If you don’t want to see it, just delete, it’s graphic. I think this is another good reason to secure our southern borders.
      
    OMG ~ even after being in Iraq and the police department investigating murders, I have never seen such disregard for a human life, but it does dispose of the body with little evidence. I can not believe how the guys in the photos just seem so relaxed...............
     
    May God help us all.

The first attachment is from the Gulf Coast HIDTA.  I didn't know if Angel
wanted to show how the information is shared among other states.  The rest
of the attachments are for money, heroin, meth and cocaine.  Let me know
what else you will need.

Two more weeks to go until the Flagstaff event and we only have 12 DPS techs planning to be there.  We could use more to represent the Department.

 

It will be Saturday, May 13 from 1000 to 1200 at the Sam’s Club parking lot in Flagstaff.  21st Century Insurance will be providing the hotel rooms for those coming from out of town.  Please check you schedules and talk to your supervisors about attending – especially if you’re near northern Arizona! 

 

Here’s the techs attending who have asked me for a hotel room.  If you are not on this list and need a hotel room, contact me ASAP.

 

Maria Wright

Jennifer Baxter

Virginia Callister

Darren Holweger

Aaron Buckmister

Brian Clark

 

Also attending but have not requested a hotel are myself, Bob Nowlan and Mark Haughey from Flagstaff, Larry Hrenchir from Williams, one of the Globe guys (with Sgt. Dave Wander for traffic control), and Charles Dimbat (Doc) from Payson.  If any of you from out of town need a room, let me know right away.  I will be requesting the rooms next week.

 

21st Century will also provide lunch after the event is over, and Erik Estrada will be there.

    Dear Civilians,

    'We know that the current state of affairs in our great nation has many
    civilians up in arms and excited to join the military.  For those of you
    who can't join, you can still lend a hand. Here are a few of the areas
    where we would like your assistance:

    1. The next time you see any adults talking (or wearing a hat) during
    the playing of the National Anthem - kick their ass.

    2. When you witness, firsthand, someone burning the American Flag in
    protest - kick their ass.

    3. Regardless of the rank they held while they served, pay the highest
    amount of respect to all veterans. If you see anyone doing otherwise,
    quietly pull them aside and explain how these veterans fought for the
    very freedom they bask in every second. Enlighten them on the many
    sacrifices these veterans made to make this Nation great. Then hold them
    down while a disabled veteran kicks their ass.

    4 (GUYS) If you were never in the military, DO NOT pretend that you
    were. Wearing battle dress uniforms (BDUs) or Jungle Fatigues, telling
    others that you used to be 'Special Forces,' and collecting GI Joe
    memorabilia, might have been okay when you were seven years old. Now, it
    will only make you look stupid and get your ass kicked.

    5. Next time you come across an Air Force member, do not ask them, 'Do
    you fly a jet?' Not everyone in the Air Force is a pilot. Such ignorance
    deserves an ass-kicking (children are exempt).

    6. If you witness someone calling the US Coast Guard 'non-military',
    Inform them of their mistake - and kick their ass.

    7. Next time Old Glory (the US flag) prances by during a parade, get on
    your damn feet and pay homage to her by placing your hand over your
    heart. Quietly thank the military member or veteran lucky enough to be
    carrying her - of course, failure to do either of those could earn you a
    severe ass-kicking..

    8. Don't try to discuss politics with a military member or a veteran. We
    are Americans, and we all bleed the same, regardless of our party
    affiliation. Our Chain of Command is to include our Commander-In-Chief
    (CinC). The President (for those who didn't know) is our CinC regardless
    of political party. We have no inside track on what happens inside those
    big important buildings where all those representatives meet. All we
    know is that when those civilian representatives screw up the situation,
    they call upon the military to go straighten it out. If you keep asking
    us the same stupid questions repeatedly, you will get your ass kicked!

    9. 'Your mama wears combat boots.' never made sense to me - stop saying
    It! If she did, she would most likely be a vet and therefore could kick
    your ass!

    10. bin Laden and the Taliban are not Communists, so stop saying 'Let's
    go kill those Commies!' And stop asking us where he is! Crystal balls
    are not standard issue in the military. That reminds me, if you see
    anyone calling those damn psychic phone numbers, let me know, so I can
    go kick their ass!

    11. 'Flyboy' (Air Force), 'Jarhead' (Marines), 'Grunt' (Army), 'Squid'
    (Navy), 'Puddle Jumpers' (Coast Guard), etc., are terms of endearment we
    use describing each other. Unless you are a service member or vet, you
    have not earned the right to use them. Using them could get your ass
    kicked.

    12. Last, but not least, whether or not you become a member of the
    military, support our troops and their families. Every Thanksgiving and
    religious holiday that you enjoy with family and friends, please
    remember that there are literally thousands of soldiers, sailors,
    marines and airmen far from home wishing they could be with their
    families. Thank God for our military and the sacrifices they make every
    day. Without them, our country would get it's 'ass kicked.'

    'It's the Veteran, not the reporter, who has given us the freedom of the

    'It's the Veteran, not the campus organizer, who gives us the freedom to
    demonstrate.'

    'It's the Military who salutes the flag, who serves beneath the flag,
    and whose coffin is draped by the flag, who allows the protester to burn
    the flag.'

    13. If you ever see anyone either standing for or singing the national
    anthem in Spanish - KICK THEIR ASS

    Last one:

    14. If you got this email and didn't pass it on - guess what - you
    deserve to get your ass kicked!

        A teacher asked her 6th grade class how many of them were Obama fans.  Not really knowing what an Obama fan is, but wanting to be liked by the teacher, all the kids raised their hands except for Little Johnny.  The teacher asked Little Johnny why he has decided to be different, again.

         

        Little Johnny said, 'Because I'm not an Obama fan.'

     

    The teacher asked, 'Why aren't you an Obama fan?'

     

    Johnny said, 'Because I'm a Republican.'

     

    The teacher asked him why he's a Republican.

     

    Little Johnny  answered, 'Well, my Mom's a Republican, and my Dad's a Republican, so I'm a Republican.'

     

    Annoyed by this answer, the teacher asked, 'If your mom was a moron, and if your dad was an idiot, what would that make you?'

     

    With a big smile, Little Johnny replied, 'That would make me an Obama fan.'

Hey guy's, it's about that time, and you were all on the privledged list give to me by the man himself expecting all of your attendence for his going away party.  Well, he's not technically going away, he's just handing over control of a vital body part over to his new master.
 
For any of you who are wondering who the hell is this guy  I'm a good friend of Ed's and Best man for their wedding so I'm responsible for rounding all you guys up and making sure everything goes smoothly.
 
This is a direct quote from Ed, so if any of you are either A) really excited for a night a strippers, or B) attempting to back out because of the same reason, this quote will act as either a disaapointment or a selling point to allow your wife to say it's ok to go.
 
As far as ideas, Jess and I are keeping this fairly tame. I suggest getting with the girls and see what the time schedule is and what you have to work with. Fun things: Kart Racing, Billiards, etc. Dinner say at the Tilted Kilt, Hooters, etc. Remember that Chuck is 18 so keep that in mind with some venues. Chuck will know that at the end of the night meet up with the girls he may not be able to go. I know this does not give you a lot to work with but it is a start.
 
With that being said by Ed, I am open to any and all suggestions.  I know they are putting in a Dave and Buster's in Tempe, that might also be a possibility.  I have no idea where all of you live, and I have not gotten comfermation as to where we will eventually meet up with the bachelorette party later on that evening.
 
What I need from you guys ASAP is to answer a few quick questions for me:
 
A) Are you in or out ( if you're out.. have well prepared excuse for Ed)
 
B) Personal opinion on whether or not you think we need transportation ( if you're not going to drink a lot fine, I'm not renting a limo for 3 people, if enough people find it to be a must, I'll do some reseach into it.  If not, once we meet we can car pool to make it a little easier for those who do plan on drinking.  Make sure to factor in additional costs involved with getting one)
 
C)Basic general area of where you live (East Valley, West Valley, etc is good enough)  Once I see where everybody is, I'll try to pick an orginating spot close to the middle, the only person given preference is Ed.
 
D) Any suggestions on what would be fun to do, taking into account the Chuck factor.  There is an ASU home game that night, so downtown Tempe will be difficult.
 
As soon as I get some feedback from all you cool-cats, I'll be able to give everyone some more definate details into the evening.  Remember the 13th of October...
 
Eric

Yes I have a myspace page.  Its 25dirtygirl@hotmail.com thats not actually my email address though. Someone else made the page and everything for me and thats just what they made up for the email.  Thats cool on the load. Was is heading west bound?? I heard on the scanner yesterday that DPS was gonna assist another agency on 85 with a failure to yield and it was a 309 load but I think they were called off and had to let it go.  It was a van with 2 hispanic guys in it.  I think DPS was ready to spike it 2. I think I should know more about the training 2day.  Task force said yes, but I have a feeling the Chief will say no. But anyways, I'm heading to Vegas this weekend, I can't wait.  Its gonna be a blast.

    Shelly,
     
    I am on a few people's myspace page from quartzsite and parker area.  do you have a myspace page?  I think it is a very cool way to stay in touch with people.  Alot of my friends are police officers.  anyways work was good I trained and then on my way home another officer got 200 lbs and I ran D.K. on the vehicle for training and of course she alerted.  anyways have a great day.  good luck with that training.

            Hey Shelly,
             
            sorry it took me forever to get these out to you.  Hopefully these will work.  but if you didnt have it before this is my email address.  Tomorrow I will get the info about that training in el paso to you.  I am going into work around noon so it will be after that I will either email you or call you about it.  The task force should have recieved a flyer in the mail cause that is where I got mine.  But anyways how is Q town going?  it should starting to pick up, it is getting to be that time of the year.  I should be passing through there on the 17th of October... so next week.  So let ponce know that I have a trial in the morning in parker but after I will be passing through to say hi to everybody again.  but anyways gotta go have a great night.
